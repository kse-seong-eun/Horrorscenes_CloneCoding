        An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
      </h3>
      <p>
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          <p>little film featuring stellar performances by all with beautiful cinematography and direction. Emma Booth, who plays Evelyn White, is particularly inspired and… unhinged.

She’s so good in fact that you find yourself almost rooting for her in one moment and completely repelled by her in the next.<br><br>
          Hounds Of Love isn’t breaking any new ground here, but due to the quality of the final product and a couple of truly harrowing scenes, I’d say it’s worth a watch.</p><br>

          <p>Sometimes the simplest premise makes for a deliciously chilling ride. In an effort to jump start their failing marriage, Gerald and wife Jessie take to their lake house for a weekend of adventurous role-play and sexual escapades, but things go… wrong. I saved this film for a night when I couldn’t find anything else to watch. My expectations were low, but it didn’t take long to realize I wasn’t watching another lazy Stephen King adaptation. Gerald’s Game is actually quite good, with the majority of the film being carried more than capably by actor Carla Gugino who is given the impossible task of performing while chained to a bed. There are a few particularly unnerving scenes, one of which I’ve featured here, and another that is incredibly difficult to watch.<br><br>So, move this one out of your when-you-can’t-find-anything-else pile and give it a shot!

          <h2>Black Swan (2010)</h2>
          <span>Directed by Darren Aronofsky</span>
        </div>
        <img src="img/86_black-swan.png" alt="movieImage">
        <div class="movieDescription">
          <p>Possibly for the first time in his career as a director, most of the post-release chatter centered around Natalie Portman’s performance and the things she had to do to prepare for the role, and not around Aronofsky as a writer or director. There is good reason, as Portman’s performance is thoroughly convincing and gleefully unhinged.<br>
            I love so much about this film. I feel like it shows Aronofsky at his artistic peak (well, The Wrestler is pretty fantastic, too). The documentary-style hand-held camera work really adds to the frenetic atmosphere, especially as Nina (Portman) falls deeper and deeper into psychosis. I’m particularly fond of the many scenes where the camera follows Nina from behind as she navigates the city streets and the labyrinthian hallways of Lincoln Center, all the while catching fleeting glimpses of herself in other people’s faces and distorted reflections.<br>While there are many scenes that might be considered more traditional Horror (Nina’s compulsive skin picking; Beth stabbing herself in the face with a nail file), it’s the psychological hold it takes on you that has the strongest effect. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique do a great job at dropping the viewer into Nina’s paranoid mind, making her a proxy of sorts, and you, the viewer, the intended target.</p><br>
